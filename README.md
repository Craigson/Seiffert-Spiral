# Seiffert-Spiral
Processing sketch that draws a particle system where particles follow the curve of a spherical Seiffert Spiral
Created by Craig Pickard

The jacobi.py python script utilises the scipy library's special ellipj function to calculate the x,y,z z values
for a predetermined number of points using the jacobi elliptic functions.  These values are saved to separate text
files and imported by the processing sketch.
